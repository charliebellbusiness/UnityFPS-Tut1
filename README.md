# UnityFPS-Tut1
 
A simple FPS Tutorial series from Jimmy Vega, making my own textures when it sounds fun.

This project is intended to familiarize myself with Unity as a tool to make First Person games, mostly Shooters. FPSRPG is one of my favourite genres with notable entries such as: Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, the Borderlands franchise as a whole, Destiny 1 and 2, and many more.

I'll likely reuse some assets of this project for smaller repositories/projects that serve to demonstrate movement capabilities or developing systems independently of larger projects. All textures and assets in this project are free to use. Be warned: there is plenty of MS Paint nonsense in these assets!
